#Updating Documentation
####The goal of this file is simply to offer a comprehensive checklist of things we must check when updating the documentation.

1. Changelog: 
 - Is [Changelog.md](https://github.com/scp-fs2open/fs2open.github.com/blob/master/Changelog.md) up-to-date with the latest release?
 - Is it in the proper [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format? 
2. Build instructions:  
 - If a programmer who never built FSO before read the build instruction at [Readme.md](https://github.com/scp-fs2open/fs2open.github.com/blob/master/Readme.md), would they manage to build FSO? 
 - Is the information in the file up-to-date regarding other matters (such as versions of tools mentioned, links to other guides, etc.)?
 - Is the information in the [Building](https://github.com/scp-fs2open/fs2open.github.com/wiki/Building) article, and its sub-articles, still up-to-date?
3. Forums: 
 - Does the [Forum](https://www.hard-light.net/forums/index.php?board=50.0) contain enough clear information to help a new developer find their way into the up-to-date instructions?
 - Is there anything that might mislead a new developer to stumble onto old tools, dead links and/or old versions of the project?
